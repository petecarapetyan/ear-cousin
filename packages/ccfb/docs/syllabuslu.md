# Syllabus Look Ups

This simulates something in the nature of a syllabus lookup table

It would have entries that correspond to things like:

- Week 10 Lesson 03
- Week 10 Lesson 04
- Week 10 Lesson 05
- Assignment8

It would probably also need keys to specific cohorts for filtering, and such as that.

## Why this might not be needed

This might instead be replaced by REST access to proffesso.com data - kinda goes without saying.

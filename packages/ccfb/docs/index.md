# CRUD examples

These are examples only. Would be regenerated iteratively until a workable schema is arrived at for each entity.

All CRUD is shown without graphic design, proper views, formatting, filters, lookups etc.

Once a schema is deemed sufficient, further customization such as lookups to other CRUD, use-case specific views, role based access to specific views, etc - are worked on individually.

Primary:
- [people](/person) - of all types staff, student, etc
- [knowledge base](/knowledge) - FAQ, troubleshooting, glossaries, etc
- [event history](/event) - for things like submissions of assignments, checkins, questions

Lookups/Filters:
- [cohort](/cohort) - listings, such as Sept 2021 - mostly for use as a lookup or filter table
- [Course/Syllabus Item Lookups](/syllabuslu) - for lookup table columns to other tables show here


## Other content

This site is built from markup, so any content can be added by merely creating Markdown pages

## Alpha site

This site is not ready for prime time. Specific pages could be made ready for specific groups, but it is not intended for public usage.

Role based access to all but a few public pages are ready for initial setup, once roles and admin has been established for use cases as discovered through initial usage.
